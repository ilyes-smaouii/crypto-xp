# crypto-xp
## Intro/context
Will try to experiment with cryptography here.

## Ideas/things to explore
- Tiny Encryption Algorithm
- AES, DES, RSA, SHA, etc.
- Different round counts
- zero-knowledge proofs
- post-quantum cryptography
Things to try : messages with signature, end-to-end encryption, checksums, etc.

Started reading up on Tiny Ecryption Algorithm, which is apparently simpler than some of the more usual ones.
Will continue reading up on it, and if it seems relevant and reasonable, I'll try to implement it.\
Other encryption algorithms like Caeser's cipher, Vigenere, etc. would be even simpler, but I've already
had experience with those, and I don't think they're interesting enough to spend time on, considering I want
to move on to more "serious" and modern algorithms, such as AES, DES, etc.\
If I find that code, which I wrote a few years ago, maybe I'll upload it to my GitHub.
In the meantime, I'm focusing on other stuff.\
Update : just took a quick look at TEA implementation, and it seems even simpler than I imagined, which
is nice to start off easy.

Wrote quite a bit of code already.
TO-DO : clear up how I'm going to represent different number in memory (and byte order, most notably).
